.symmetric_difference()

The .symmetric_difference() operator returns a set with all the elements that are in the set and the iterable but not both.
Sometimes, a ^ operator is used in place of the .symmetric_difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set.
The set is immutable to the .symmetric_difference() operation (or ^ operation).

>>> s = set("Hacker")
>>> print s.symmetric_difference("Rank")
set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])

>>> print s.symmetric_difference(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])

>>> print s.symmetric_difference(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])

>>> print s.symmetric_difference(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', (0, 'R'), 'r', (2, 'n'), 'k', (1, 'a'), (3, 'k')])

>>> print s.symmetric_difference({"Rank":1})
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'Rank', 'r'])

>>> s ^ set("Rank")
set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])
